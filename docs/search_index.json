The command bookdown::render_book() renders all .Rmd files defined in _bookdown.yaml and puts the end result into the /docs directory. This is the directory where Github creates the Homepage from. Here are some suggestions on technical stuff during writing: 0. Do not modify the files in the /docs directory. 1. NEVER push directly to the group repository Make a fork to your personal GitHub Account Make changes in this fork Use a pull request once you are satisfied with you changes 2. Main branch = Clean version The main branch is used to render the Homepage I suggest using branches sparsely but i fell like we need at least a “dev” branch. 3. Figures (Suggestion) R code that produces figures for the book should not be directly executed in the .Rmd files for the chapters. Instead use an external script that saves a .svg file. This way we also have a clean version of the figure itself (e.g. for sharing or presentations) In the chapters then use a code chunk that just contains knitr::include_graphics().
