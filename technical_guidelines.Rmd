# Technical guidelines {#TG}

The file `_bookdown.yaml` defines the structure of the chapters.
The command `bookdown::render_book()` renders all `.Rmd files` defined in `_bookdown.yaml` and puts the end result into the `/docs` directory. This is the directory where Github creates the [Homepage](https://loek-rs.github.io/spatialml/) from.


Here are some suggestions on technical stuff during writing:

**0. Do not modify the files in the `/docs` directory.**


**1. NEVER push directly to the group repository**

* Make a fork to your personal GitHub Account
* Make changes in this fork
* Use a pull request once you are satisfied with you changes


**2. Main branch = Clean version**

* The main branch is used to render the [Homepage](https://loek-rs.github.io/spatialml/)
* I suggest using branches sparsely but i fell like we need at least a "dev" branch.

**3. Figures (Suggestion)**

* R code that produces figures for the book should not be directly executed in the `.Rmd` files for the chapters.
* Instead use an external script that saves a `.svg` file.
* This way we also have a clean version of the figure itself (e.g. for sharing or presentations)
* In the chapters then use a code chunk that just contains `knitr::include_graphics()`.
